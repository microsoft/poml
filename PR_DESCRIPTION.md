# Add VS Code Language Model API Integration

## Summary

This PR implements comprehensive support for VS Code's Language Model API, allowing POML users to leverage GitHub Copilot and other language models without configuring API keys. This addresses issue #80 and significantly improves the user experience.

## Changes Made (Updated After Review)

### Based on PR Feedback
- âœ… Merged `testCommandEnhanced.ts` directly into existing `testCommand.ts` 
- âœ… Removed unnecessary `gallery/api_doc_generation.poml`
- âœ… Simplified code review example (removed complex stylesheet)
- âœ… Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Properly registered commands in extension

### Core Implementation
1. **VS Code LM Provider** (`packages/poml-vscode/providers/vscodeLMProvider.ts`)
   - Complete integration with VS Code Language Model API
   - Automatic model detection and validation
   - Streaming support with cancellation tokens

2. **Integrated Test Command** (`packages/poml-vscode/command/testCommand.ts`)
   - Seamlessly integrated VS Code LM support
   - Automatic fallback when no API key configured
   - No duplicate command files

3. **New Commands** (`packages/poml-vscode/command/detectModelsCommand.ts`)
   - `poml.detectVSCodeModels` - Detect available language models
   - `poml.autoConfigureLM` - Auto-configure POML to use VS Code LM

## Testing Results âœ…
