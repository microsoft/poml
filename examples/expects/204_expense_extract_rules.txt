# Task

From the email from employee, policy PDF and the budget CSV, select ONLY rules that apply to the extracted documents. Prefer numeric caps and binary requirements. Represent each as a compact rule object. Infer trip_context (is_international, trip_length_days) from dates/locations if available; if not infer conservative defaults.

When considering rules, take into account: 

- receipt threshold (> a specific number)
- lodging $/night caps
- meals per diem (domestic vs international)
- ground transportation per-day and per-trip caps
- rental car class restriction
- communications cap/day and per-trip
- visa/travel docs reimbursable per-trip cap
- exceptions need CFO approval
- ...

**Hint:** Keep scope domestic/international as needed. Use USD per the budget table.
