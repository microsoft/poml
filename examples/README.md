# POML Example Library

This directory contains example POML files demonstrating a variety of use cases. Examples are organized by difficulty:

- **Beginner:** Filenames start with `1XX_`
- **Intermediate:** Filenames start with `2XX_`
- **Advanced:** Filenames start with `3XX_`

Each example highlights different POML features, such as structured prompting, data handling, and templating.

Non-POML examples (e.g., Python or JavaScript scripts) are prefixed with `4XX_` and use appropriate file extensions. Inline comments explain their usage.
